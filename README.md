HTML Form

Creates a form with input fields for personal details.
Each input field has a name attribute and a required attribute to ensure the field is filled in.
JavaScript Code

Gets the form element and adds an event listener to the submit event.
When the form is submitted, it:
Prevents the default form submission behavior.
Creates a new FormData object from the form data.
Validates the form data using the validateFormData function.
If the data is valid, sends a POST request to the server with the form data.
If the data is invalid, displays an error message.
Validate Form Data Function

Checks if all required fields have a value by iterating over the form data entries.
Returns true if all fields have a value, and false otherwise.
I removed unnecessary details and focused on the main functionality of the code. Let me know if you have any further requests!
